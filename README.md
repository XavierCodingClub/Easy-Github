## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This repo is meant to test your skill in forking/cloning and editing another person's repo. This is code for a simple rock paper scissors game, we ask you to make the following edits (sorted from esiest to hardest):

- Add a variable "computerChoice" and make it be randomly assigned a valid choice
- Change variables to be more readable (i.e turn "var1" to "Choice")
- Instead of there being only 3 options, add 2 of your own, for example, Lizard and Spock as outlined in the chart below:
